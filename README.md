JOSM MovementAlert Plugin 
======

This plugin will display an alert whenever an object is moved a long distance (such as by a misoperation).

Most of mappers have moved nodes and ways by misoperations.
Many power mappers have moved stray buildings back to their original places.
This plugin alerts when unnaturally long movements are made to confirm that the operations are really intended.
